            <p style="color: black;">Unlike others of its kin, Leatherbacks does not have a strong, bony carapace. Instead, as their name suggests, the shell is more reminiscent of leather. A design that has not changed much in 100 million years, these turtles have roamed Earth since the time of dinosaurs. 
                Ridges along its shell gives a hydrodynamic design, giving Leatherback sea turtles the ability to dive to a depth of 1200 meters and stay underneath for up to 85 minutes. Unlike other reptiles, they also possess the ability to generate and maintain body temperature in cold environments. 
                Jellyfish is the main diet, making them crucial for the overall health of the ocean. A very uncommon feature among sea turtles, the Leatherback mouth is designed for gelatinous prey with its sharp jaw and tooth-like cusps, as a contrast to the chewing plates commonly found in other sea turtles. One of the main threats for Leatherback sea turtles are ocean pollution, like balloons and plastic bags as they are easily confused for jellyfish.
